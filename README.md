# Momentum Ignition Strategy – Simulation Report

## High-Level Strategy and Core Logic

The **Momentum Ignition Strategy** is designed to simulate and analyze the market impact of aggressive order execution in a limit order book environment. The core logic is as follows:

- **Direction Selection:** The strategy determines whether to buy or sell based on which side of the order book has less liquidity, aiming to maximize price movement with minimal resistance.
- **Order Cascade:** Orders are submitted in a cascade, with each new order potentially larger than the previous if momentum is detected (i.e., if price moves in the intended direction and liquidity thins).
- **Impact and Slippage Awareness:** Before each order, the expected price impact and slippage are estimated using the current order book. After execution, the actual impact is measured.
- **Adaptive Escalation:** If the market shows momentum (price moves as intended and liquidity thins), the strategy escalates order size more aggressively. Otherwise, it increases size gradually to maintain pressure.
- **Termination:** The cascade stops when a target price impact is achieved, capital is exhausted, or a maximum number of cascades is reached.

## Key Assumptions and Configurable Parameters

- **Order Book Depth and Liquidity:** The simulation assumes a deep, random, but configurable order book (e.g., 1,000–10,000 levels, 1,000–500,000 units per level).
- **Market Data Dynamics:** Price can evolve stochastically (random walk) between orders, but can be set to deterministic for pure impact analysis.
- **Execution Model:** All orders are market or aggressive limit orders, ensuring immediate execution and observable price impact.
- 
### Strategy Parameters

- `InitialOrderSize`: The starting size for the first order in the cascade.
- `OrderSizeMultiplier`: The factor by which the order size increases when momentum is detected.
- `MaxCascadeDepth`: The maximum number of escalation steps (orders) allowed.
- `MaxCapital`: The total capital that can be spent by the strategy.
- `TargetPriceImpact`: The target price movement (as a percentage) at which the strategy stops.
- `OrderInterval`: The time delay between consecutive orders.
- `AggressionFactor`: Controls how much more aggressive each subsequent order is (for limit orders).

### Simulation/Market Parameters

- `Instrument.Symbol`: The ticker symbol of the traded asset (e.g., `PUM.DE`).
- `Instrument.Name`: The full name of the asset (e.g., `PUMA SE`).
- `Instrument.TickSize`: The minimum price increment between order book levels (e.g., `0.01` EUR).
- `Instrument.Currency`: The trading currency.
- `Instrument.MinOrderSize / MaxOrderSize`: The allowed range for individual order sizes (e.g., `1` to `100,000` units).
- `InitialPrice`: The starting price for the simulation (e.g., `45.50`).
- `VolatilityPercent`: The annualized volatility used for simulating random price movements (e.g., `2%`).
- `OrderBookDepth`: The number of price levels on each side of the order book (e.g., `10`).
- `MaxSpreadPercent`: The maximum allowed spread as a percentage of price (e.g., `0.1%`).
- `LiquidityRefreshRate`: How frequently the order book liquidity is refreshed (e.g., `0.1` means 10% of levels refreshed per update).

All these parameters are configurable and allow you to simulate a wide range of market conditions, from highly liquid, stable markets to thin, volatile ones.

## Strategy Analysis

### Momentum Ignition Strategy

The Momentum Ignition strategy operates by placing strategically timed orders designed to trigger algorithmic responses from other market participants. This approach leverages market microstructure dynamics to amplify price movements with minimal capital deployment.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Cascade Effect**: Orders are sized to trigger progressive responses
- **Timing Optimization**: Exploits market liquidity patterns
- **Risk Management**: Built-in capital and position controls

**Performance Assessment**: Lower efficiency suggests market conditions may not have been optimal for this strategy.
